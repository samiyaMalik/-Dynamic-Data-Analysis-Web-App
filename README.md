# 🚀 Dynamic-Data-Analysis-Web-App🚀 
This repository contains the code for a Python-based web application that facilitates interactive data analysis directly from your browser. Built using Flask, Pandas, and Seaborn, this app allows users to upload datasets, perform various types of analyses, and download visualizations.

## 📋 Features

- **File Upload**: Supports CSV, TXT, and XLSX file formats for easy data input.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Generate histograms to explore the distribution of individual variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between two variables.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Use pair plots to uncover complex relationships within your data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: The core language for the application.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to create the web interface.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating visualizations and plots.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic front-end for the user interface.
